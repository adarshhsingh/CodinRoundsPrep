/**
 * When to Use:
 *
 * 1. When you want a single object to coordinate actions across a system.
 *
 * 2. Services can be singleton since they store the state,
 *    configuration, and provide access to resources.
 *
 * 3. Databases such as MongoDB utilize the Singleton pattern for
 *    database connections.
 *
 * 4. Configurations are used if there is an object with a specific
 *    configuration, and we donâ€™t need a new instance every time that
 *    configuration object is needed.
